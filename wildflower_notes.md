oklahoma wildflower seeds make a whole bunch of different kinds of flowers before time is up in the season. and each of them leaves behind seeds to propagate the next generation.

they begin with the indian paintbrush, a green cone which turns pink and then red in the early morning mist on spring time highways. theyre the first ones to come up. after that, really during that time, the crimson clover grows leaves and prepares to bloom. the ground under them maintains its moisture better and makes the ground soft. its then when the paintbrush comes out and its a great time of year in oklahoma. after that its daisies, poppies, cornflowers, bluenonnets. cone flowers then sunflowers, noblesse oblige. correopsis when it gets hot then they turn into trees. by that time its october and time for football. at that point buy some more seeds.
