SVG of this please: 

in late summer i would think about the cycles of wildflowers that had come and gone. 

late cycles of wildflower in summer -- five pounds of oklahoma native seed 

wildflowers planted free and easy. unfettered by thoughts of wind, rain, gain. an investment in the scene it was 

wildflowers i bought off amazon -- 5 pounds for a good price -- mix it in with crimson clover. plant fifteen pounds twice once in fall once in winter. fall plants grow better, but fun to put seeds out in snow and watch them germinate. they grow a base and split open, they shed their seed shell and erupt into healthy shades of green. they spit out a two headed leaf as a solar panel and then follow the sun. i see them at different times of the day and smile to them, we both follow the sun. i plant more seeds over the top of these, sometimes when i see them like this in early spring. its nice these spring days when its warm. ill clump together soybean seeds and crimson clover, or wheat with crimson clover and throw them into pastures. its good for cows, birds, deer, bees, and grass. i like planting grass too but mostly plant wildflowers and clover. clover is a miracle plant i hear and does well to help you grow vegetables on any patch of ground. in a field or a patch of clover you can disperse randomly vegetable seeds amongst eachother, watermelon, pumpkin, grape, bean, tree, etc and build a patch. rye grass does better in shade and makes good for barefeet walkin. sometimes sittin on the ground too. 

oklahoma wildflower seeds make a whole bunch of different kinds of flowers before time is up in the season. and each of them leaves behind seeds to propgate the next generation. though each year i overseed to help them out. they begin with the indian paintbrush, a green cone which turns pink and then red in the early morning mist on spring time highways. theyre the first ones to come up. after that, really during that time, the crimson clover grows leaves and prepares to bloom. the ground under them maintains its moisture better and makes the ground soft. its then when the paintbrush comes out and its a great time of year in oklahoma. after that its daisies, poppies, cornflowers, bluenonnets, that come out. cone flowers then sunflowers, noblesse oblige. correopsis when it gets hot then they turn into trees. by that time its october and time for football. at that point buy some more seeds. such is the life cycle of an okie wildflwoer
