“You mean this flight?” The airline desk employee pointed out the window.

John thanked the woman and smiled. He asked about the nearest hotels. The woman gave him some options, he thanked her again, then went to the Narita train terminal. John walked with his carry-on backpack (all he brought with him) out of the airport and to the train terminal.

Now out in Tokyo it was about 11pm. He dropped off his bag at a capsule hostel and went to the bars near the statue of the famous dog in Shibuya. The taxis were a blast from the past. People smoked cigarettes inside 1950's style diners, tourists were all around, faces in the street were lit up by large transforming LED advertisements on the buildings. Triangles, rectangles, spinning, circles, music from many parts of the world, techno-lofi beat music, American music.

Next day John didn't check flights. He went back to sleep in the capsule and laughed a little. He thought about the paper he presented with Fujimori on an enhanced understanding of rice genetics. He was proud of the paper and of what he and Fujimori had acheived, though here in the capsule he thought about what it felt like to wake up under the tree and to see the Great Lakes fescue for the first time, and know what it was without looking it up — knowing that the system was working, even that his sleeping there made the whole thing work — thinking about this he laughed and made plans to visit his friend Fujimori.

From an academic perspective there was very much work John knew needed to be done. It had been two months since he'd missed his flight and, fortuitously, he caught the planting season, a rainy autumn now nearing winter on the japanese coast. He had done very much work with little writing. While working and being alone in the fields most days he felt he had figured out nearly the last of it. It was time to test these plants on the moon.
